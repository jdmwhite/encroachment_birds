Occupancy models for modeling the population trends of southern African birds against woody cover change

This project contains 4 scripts to produce the results of the paper titled: "Woody plant encroachment drives population declines in 20% of common open ecosystem bird species". The first script installs the required libraries, the second runs the dynamic occupancy models, the third extracts the relevant model estimates and the fourth produces the primary figure for comparing winner vs. loser birds.

As shown in script 1, the occupancy models were run using version 1.3.2 of the unmarked package.

The cleaned data and models can be found at figshare (10.6084/m9.figshare.25577460). To run the full analysis download the zipped figshare folder and move the respective files into the data and processed folders. This repository includes the first species used in the analysis, the Secratary bird (SABAP2 ID: 105).
